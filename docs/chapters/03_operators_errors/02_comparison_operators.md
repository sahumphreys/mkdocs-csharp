!!! note "From the syllabus"
    AQA: Be familiar with and be able to use ... (3.1.1.4/4.1.1.4)}
    
    - equal to, not equal to, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to

Comparison operators are used to compare two or more values/variables returning either ```true``` or ```false``` (boolean values).  They work as you would expect from Maths, in the table below we'll assume ```a = 4``` and ```b = 5```:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| ```>``` |  greater than | ```a > b``` -> False|
| ```<``` | less than | ```a < b``` -> True |
| ```>=``` | greater than, or equal to |```a >= b``` -> False|
| ```<=``` | less than, or equal to |```a <= b``` -> True|
| ```==``` | equal to | ```a == b``` -> False|
| ```!=``` | not equal to |```a != b``` -> True|



Be careful with ```==``` and do not confuse it with the assignment operator ```=```.
