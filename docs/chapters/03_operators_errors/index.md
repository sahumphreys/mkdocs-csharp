title: Operators and Handling Errors
---

!!! note "In this chapter"

    - Apply __arithmetic operators__ to values
    - Learn other operators including __comparison__, __logical__ and __binary__ operators
    - Describe __syntax errors__, __logic errors__, and __runtime errors__
    - Learn how to __cast__ one data type to anotherâ€‹

At its heart the computer is really just a very big calculator, taking in data and processing that data using a variety of different operators.  These operators include:

- __Arithmetic__: plus, minus, multiply etc.
- __Assignment__: assigning values to variables
- __Comparison__: comparing two literal values or variables
- __Logical__: operators that work on Boolean data types
- __Binary__: to carry out operations on binary digits (bits)
- __Type conversion__: to convert from one data type to another

There is an order or precedence with these operators. Just as in Maths multiplication takes precedence over addition but when using complex expressions it is advisable to use brackets to force precedence:  brackets, division and multiplication, addition and subtraction.

Here we will review each of these operators categories and how they are used with C#.
