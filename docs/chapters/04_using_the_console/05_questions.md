## Additional Exercises

1. Write a program that reads from the console the radius "r" of a circle and prints its area and circumference.
2. Write a program that reads two numbers from the console and prints the greater of them. Can you solve this problem without using conditional statements? (Hint:  The library `Math` contains methods for `Max` and `Min`)
3. Write a program that reads five integer numbers and prints their sum. If an invalid number is entered the program should prompt the user to enter another number.
4. Research how to print Unicode characters to the console using .NET (C\#).
