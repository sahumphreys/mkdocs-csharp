title: Programming Task - Running Club
---

# {{ title }}

Peter runs a local running club.  He wants a program to keep membership information for his club members.  To keep it simple, he just needs to store the first name, last name and preferred running distance (5k, 10k, half-marathon, marathon, ultra) in a file.

Write a program that enables Peter to add new members, display all members and to search for a member by surname.  

NB.  Data should be saved to a file (`.TXT` or `.CSV`) and the program should use the `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter` classes.

__CHALLENGE__:  

- Present a list of available distances so Peter can choose before saving the member to the file
- Amend the program so Peter can list the runners in his club that prefer a given distance
